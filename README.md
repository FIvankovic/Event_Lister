# Event_Lister
Php project for college. Users can create their accounts and subscribe to different events. 
Managers can create and edit events. 
Admins can do everything manager does, and manipulate the data in the database.


## Note
Due to the project having been hosted on a server owned by the college, the project isn't working anymore.
The code and the rest of the project have saved here on Github for the purpose of showcasing, study and mostly just archiving. 
Its sad when unique data is permanently lost.
